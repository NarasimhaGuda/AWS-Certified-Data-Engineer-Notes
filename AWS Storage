### Amazon S3 - Buckets
  > Buckets are defined at the region level not globally
  >  Naming convention
       • No uppercase, No underscore
       • 3-63 characters long
       • Not an IP
       • Must start with a lowercase letter or number
       • Must NOT start with the prefix xn-
       • Must NOT end with the suffix -s3alias

### Amazon s3 - Objects

  • Objects (files) have a Key                                                                                
  • The key is the FULL path:
  • s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
  • s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
  • The key is composed of prefix + object name
  • s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
  • There’s no concept of “directories” within buckets
    (although the UI will trick you into thinking otherwise)
  • Just keys with very long names that contain 
    slashes (“/”)

### s2- Object(Cont)

 • Object values are the content of the body:
 • Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
 • If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
 • Metadata (list of text key/value pairs – system or user metadata)
 • Tags (Unicode key/value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / 
         lifecycle
 • Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
